I'm Dominik. Currently, I am
the founder of Creed and work there as a security auditor. My main work concerns Ethereum smart contracts but I'm also
interested in:

- Backend engineering in Python and Elixir
- The security of smart contract systems
- Penetration testing and CTF contests
- Peer-to-peer network design and implementation

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/dmuhs/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lethalspoons). Come say hi!
