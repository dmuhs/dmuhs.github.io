In recent weeks, Germany has been on the international news. In the state elections in Thuringia and Saxony (where I live), the extreme right-wing AfD and the extreme left-wing BSW have gotten huge voter support. Their focus on immigration, border security, and crime, but also skilled harping on East-West differences in Germany seem to have had a significant impact.

## Some Background

Describing East Germany is tough. I grew up here, in Saxony-Anhalt, in a city close to where the border used to be and countless people lost their lives trying to escape the socialist GDR regime. I was born in 1994, five years after the wall came down. Giant bald strips cut into the dense forest, abandoned surveillance buildings and watchtowers, and mined patches with warning signs still are vivid memories of my childhood, however.

People here are crafty, support each other, and often crave stability. In the GDR, work used to be organized around the workplace. Factory-owned sports teams, factory-owned houses in nice spots to take a vacation at, etc. After the reunification, the vast majority of these factories and associated real estate were sold to West German corporations for a fraction of their value. Most locations were promptly closed to remove market competition. When the Treuhand closed in 1994, it's tab racked up more than [3 million destroyed jobs and a debt mountain of 264 billion D-Mark](https://www.mdr.de/geschichte/ddr/deutsche-einheit/treuhand/betriebe-verkauf-volkseigentum-100.html). Accounting for exchange rate and inflation adjustment, that's â‚¬234.5B. This what can only be described as sale of East Germany left many communities in economic shock that lasts to this day.

As a result of economic hardship, "the West" always looked more attractive. International communities, a higher median salary, more career prospects, all the classics. Whoever had a higher degree or was skilled at a trade, would have better chances there. This brain drain continued long after the reunification. In 2013, when I moved away from home to study in Dresden, my parents told me to not move back home after my degree. They said something along the lines of *"only the old and the stupid remain here"*.

Apparently, I was not the only one. There are impressive statistics showing east-west migration inside Germany. One that particularly stuck with me is the [migration statistics by gender](https://www.bib.bund.de/Publikation/2012/pdf/Jung-weiblich-geht-Abwanderung-und-Geschlechterungleichgewichte-in-ostdeutschen-Landkreisen.pdf).

While these numbers have [slightly decreased in the last years](https://www.iwkoeln.de/studien/wido-geis-thoene-anja-katrin-orth-weniger-frauen-gehen-maennerueberschuss-bleibt-bestehen-302444.html), the overpopulation in men remains. Some sociologists hypothesize that there is a correlation with a higher population in men and extreme political ideas emerging. That's theory, however, and I'm neither a sociologist nor do I have time for a research tangent right now.

I am trying to paint a picture for you, dear reader, of what might trouble people in East Germany. It's not that hard to feel empathy with someone who feels "left behind" because their salary hasn't grown in the last 10 years but everything is twice as expensive. Then the pub next door closes because there is not enough business. Then the supermarket next door so not you have to drive 15 minutes to get to the other one. Then the neighborhood you grew up in gets bulldozed because there is no demand for living space. But at the same time rents are increasing. Your landlord? Never met them. They sit somewhere in Bavaria.

Not all is doom and gloom, however. Because of the [GDR cultural heritage where both parents had to work](https://www.bpb.de/themen/deutschlandarchiv/259587/fruehe-fremdbetreuung-in-der-ddr/) to make a living, it's [way easier to get a Kindergarden spot and daycare](https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/Projekte/Fruehkindliche_Bildung/Grafik_Betreuungswunsch_der_Eltern_fuer_unter_dreijaehrige_Kinder_noch_nicht_gedeckt_20231128.jpg). As recently measured as 2024, the [gender pay gap is significantly lower](https://www.bundestag.de/presse/hib/kurzmeldungen-1001370) and has been for many decades. There is also a lower cost of living but weighing that against the lower local salaries, the fact that significantly less people own financial assets such as real estate or stocks, I wouldn't call that an advantage.

## Political Views

Your guess is as good as mine. Experts and pseudo-experts have different hypotheses why the recent elections have taken such a hard turn towards extremist parties. There are significantly less immigrants present in East Germany and migrant crime statistics compared with local German ones are hardly significant. It could be mass media pushing individual cases into the spotlight for rage bait to maximize clicks and money, a targeted campaign by radical nationalist parties to capture votes, me government statistics too much or misinterpreting them, or a mix of all.

Personally, as someone who has studied in Dresden, worked with Afghan and Syrian refugees, and now lives in Leipzig, I feel like the respect for facts and the democratic system is on the decline. When two opposing political sides discuss, things quickly turn into an irrational clusterfuck. There is no comparison of policies, attacking the other person's ideas for lacking nuance, and consequentially having to listen to what they actually say. There is populism, catchy slogans without much substance being thrown around, and lots of feel-good rhetoric. They are strong, but we are stronger. They want to manipulate us but we are enlightened. We have been neglected for so many years and now is the time we rise up to get justice. 

I am convinced the majority of people in East Germany, the "new states", have been systematically disadvantaged. Don't believe me? Go to the Federal Office of Statistics website, pick out any map. There is a good chance you'll see the border between East and West Germany clear cut into it. Or for instant gratification, [the Berliner MoPo prepared something for you](https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/deutschland-teilen-deutsche-einheit-wiedervereinigung/). It's an impressive and yet incredibly defeating exercise.
